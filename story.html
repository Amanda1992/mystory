            SO I DID NOT ACTUALLY START IN FOSTER. THATS JUS WHERE MY LIFE BEGAN TO TURN. I ACTULLY STARTED WITH MY BIOLOGICAL MOM. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH HER OUR LIFE WAS GREAT. 
        </p>
        <p>
            AT ABOUT THREE EVERYTHING STARTED GOING WRONG. I WAS SENT TO LIVE WITH MY BROTHERS FATHERS SISTER AND HER WIFE. NOW GROWING UP I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE WORST PLACE I EVER BEEN TO BUT THINKING BACK IT WASNT SO BAD. I WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND FOR THE MOST PART I GOT WHAT I WANTED UNTIL I MISBEHAVED WHICH WAS ALWAYS. LOL. I HONESTLY JUST WANTED MY MOTHER THATS ALL I WANTED AND I WAS GOING TO GIVE EVERYONE THAT I CAME IN CONTACT WITH HELL UNTIL I DID. 
        </p>
        <p>
            WHEN I SAY I GAVE THEM HELL I GAVE THEM A RUN FOR THIER MONEY MAN. I USED TO WRITE HATE LETTERS TO THEM. TELL THEM I WANTED THEM TO DIE. IT WAS BAD. I GOT A WHOPPING ALOT. ALMOST EVERYDAY I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL I GOT A WHOPPING. BUT YET THEY STILL TRIED TO LOVE ME AND GIVE ME ALL THE AFFECTION THEY COULD. I JUST DIDNT WANT IT. MY MOM WAS MY CONCERN AND ALL I WANTED.

          I mean i wasnt retarded or anything iI just wanted my mom. I used to run away and look for at night. I used to wonder around brooklyn trying to find familiar place from the little flashbacks I had of being with my mom. I never really knew where I was going I would just walk around calling out mommy hopping she knew I was talking to her. Now that I'm older probly wasnt the best idea, but it was all I had at about 8.

          Around  age nine my family and I moved to some place in Brooklyn called Clinton Hill. They had just bought a house there and wanted to give me a better life or something. At first i was all for it new place, new school, new things to explore. I loved learning new things. When I got there and noticed I hated the kids and I hated my block back to the terrible kid they knew me as.
