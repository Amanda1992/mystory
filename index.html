                My name is Amanda. I am currently 25 years old. My life was pretty crappy from the start. I was in foster care and never really had parents.... Yada Yada. But who wants to hear the sad story of the troubled foster child with no chance to succeed.

                FROM THERE I STARTED TO TAKE A INTREST IN MULTIPLE THINGS PRETTY MUCH JUST EXPERIMENTING WITH MY LIFE. MY LIFE IS KIND OF TRIAL AND ERROR. I TRY IT IF IT FAILS I FIX THE PROBLEM AND TRY AGAIN.NOW THAT WAS NOT A GOOD WAY TO GO THRU LIFE. IT MESSED ME UP ALOT. SOME ERROR MORE THAN OTHERS. BUT I ALWAYS FIXED IT AND MOVED ON. TAKE A JOURNEY THRU MY PAST AND DISCOVER HOW I CAME TO BE THE ME I AM TODAY.
